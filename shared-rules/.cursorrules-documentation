# Documentation & Planning Patterns for Flight Booking Portal

## Document Structure Standards for Travel Systems
- Follow established patterns from airline integration specifications and booking system documentation
- Use natural language descriptions for booking flows and airline API integrations (avoid code snippets in specifications)
- Focus on booking system architecture, payment flow decisions, and airline partnership requirements
- Include comprehensive metadata: version, date, author, airline partners affected, compliance status

## Key Documentation Files for Flight Booking Systems
- **PRD.md**: Product Requirements Document with traveler user stories, booking scenarios, and airline partner acceptance criteria
- **airline_integration_specification.md**: Technical architecture for NDC API integrations, GDS connections, and airline-specific requirements
- **booking_flow_specification.md**: Complete booking journey architecture from search to confirmation
- **payment_integration_specification.md**: Secure payment processing architecture with PCI compliance requirements
- **security_compliance_specification.md**: Aviation security standards, PCI DSS compliance, and passenger data protection
- **rules.md**: Flight booking development best practices, airline integration standards, and coding guidelines
- **mvp_plan.md**: 15-day sprint plan for core booking functionality and priority airline integrations
- **roadmap_plan.md**: 12-month implementation roadmap for multi-airline expansion and advanced booking features

## Documentation Principles for Travel Technology
- Write for airline integration developers who will implement booking flows and API connections
- Include aviation industry context, IATA standards, and regulatory requirements (GDPR, PCI DSS)
- Maintain version control with airline partner approval tracking and compliance change history
- Cross-reference booking system components, airline API documentation, and payment processing guides
- Use clear section numbering with airline-specific subsections and integration hierarchies

## Planning Document Requirements for Flight Booking Systems
- **Executive summaries** for airline partnership stakeholder overview and business impact
- **Detailed technical requirements** for booking system development teams and airline integration specialists
- **Risk assessment** for airline API dependencies, payment processing failures, and booking system outages
- **Success criteria** including booking conversion rates, payment success rates, and airline SLA compliance
- **Timeline** with realistic airline integration milestones, certification requirements, and go-live dependencies

## Booking System Documentation Standards
- **Booking Flow Documentation** - Complete traveler journey from search to post-travel
- **Airline API Integration Guides** - NDC, GDS, and airline-specific integration patterns
- **Payment Processing Documentation** - Secure payment flows, refund processes, and fraud prevention
- **Error Handling Documentation** - Booking failure scenarios, airline API errors, and recovery procedures
- **Security and Compliance Documentation** - PCI DSS compliance, passenger data protection, audit requirements

## Airline Integration Planning Requirements
- **Partner Onboarding Documentation** - Step-by-step airline integration and certification process
- **API Specification Mapping** - Map airline APIs to internal booking system interfaces
- **Testing and Certification Plans** - Airline sandbox testing, production readiness, and go-live procedures
- **Monitoring and SLA Documentation** - Performance monitoring, alerting, and airline partner SLA tracking
- **Maintenance and Support Documentation** - Ongoing airline relationship management and technical support

## Markdown Standards for Travel Documentation
- Use consistent heading hierarchy (H1 for major booking flows, H2 for airline-specific sections)
- Include table of contents for complex booking system documents
- Use code blocks only for configuration examples and API endpoint references, not booking implementation code
- Include airline partnership metadata tables for integration versioning and compliance tracking
- Use bullet points for booking step sequences and numbered lists for integration procedures
