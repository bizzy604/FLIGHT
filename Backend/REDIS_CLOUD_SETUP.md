# Redis Cloud Setup for Flight Backend

## ✅ Configuration Complete & Tested!

**Endpoint:** `redis-14657.c89.us-east-1-3.ec2.redns.redis-cloud.com:14657`
**Database:** `database-MCTJ1VQX`
**Status:** ✅ Connection tested and working perfectly!

## ✅ Ready for Deployment!

Your Redis configuration is set up for both local development and production deployment.

### Environment Configuration

**Local Development (.env file):**
```
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379
REDIS_DB=0
REDIS_PASSWORD=
```

**Production Deployment (render.yaml):**
```
REDIS_URL=redis://default:9CTbyLNREutwAduVCxkCA9kgI3sj9tEG@redis-14657.c89.us-east-1-3.ec2.redns.redis-cloud.com:14657/0
```

### Test Results ✅

Connection test completed successfully:
- ✅ Redis connection established
- ✅ Data storage and retrieval working
- ✅ Data compression working (82.2% compression ratio)
- ✅ Session management working
- ✅ Automatic cleanup working

### 3. Alternative: Using Redis URL Format

Instead of individual variables, you can use a single Redis URL:

```
REDIS_URL = redis://default:[your-password]@redis-14657.c89.us-east-1-3.ec2.redns.redis-cloud.com:14657/0
```

Replace `[your-password]` with your actual Redis Cloud password.

### 4. Test the Connection

After deployment, check your Render logs for:
- ✅ `Redis connection established successfully to redis-14657.c89.us-east-1-3.ec2.redns.redis-cloud.com:14657`
- ❌ If you see connection errors, double-check the password

## Benefits You'll Get

With Redis Cloud connected, your application will have:

- **✅ Session Persistence:** Flight search results cached for 30 minutes
- **✅ Better Performance:** Reduced API calls to flight providers  
- **✅ Improved User Experience:** Seamless navigation between search → pricing → booking
- **✅ Data Compression:** Efficient storage of flight response data
- **✅ Automatic Expiration:** Data automatically cleaned up after 30 minutes

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
- Verify the password is correct
- Ensure the Redis Cloud database is active
- Check that the endpoint and port are exactly as provided

### Environment Variable Issues
- Make sure `REDIS_PASSWORD` is set as a secret variable
- Verify all Redis environment variables are properly configured
- Check Render logs for specific error messages

### Testing Locally
To test the connection locally, set these environment variables:

```bash
export REDIS_HOST=redis-14657.c89.us-east-1-3.ec2.redns.redis-cloud.com
export REDIS_PORT=14657
export REDIS_DB=0
export REDIS_PASSWORD=your-password
```

Then run your application and check the logs.

## Security Notes

- **Never commit passwords to version control**
- **Use Render's secret environment variables for REDIS_PASSWORD**
- **Redis Cloud provides SSL/TLS encryption by default**
- **Your database is isolated and secure**

## Next Steps

1. **Get your Redis password** from Redis Cloud dashboard
2. **Add environment variables** in Render dashboard
3. **Deploy your application**
4. **Check logs** to confirm Redis connection
5. **Test flight search/booking** to verify caching works

Your Redis Cloud setup is ready to go once you add the password!
